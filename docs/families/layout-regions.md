# Layout regions contract

## Intent

A page or bounded work area should have predictable structural regions before
its product content is added. Builders can use a generic Section, a five-slot
Layout primitive, or a contextual Toolbar without each surface inventing its
own inset, boundary, region direction, or content ownership. AppShell owns the
page shell that composes these lower-level regions with application navigation.

## Membership rule

A component belongs when its primary public purpose is defining a stable
structural region: a generic page/content region, a named position in Layout's
five-slot topology, or a contextual action region. Members may compose shared
layout primitives, but they own a stronger boundary than arbitrary-child
arrangement alone.

- **Members:** Section; Layout and its Header, Content, Footer, and Panel regions;
  Toolbar.
- **Collaborators:** `family:layout-primitives` supplies arbitrary-child
  arrangement utilities; `architecture:container-padding` supplies the broader
  inset and bleed system used by Section, Layout and its regions, Table, Toolbar,
  and Divider; useResizable and ResizeHandle may drive a panel's size; AppShell
  owns the page shell and composes Layout with application navigation; component
  theming owns visual targets.
- **Excluded:** Stack, Grid, Center, and their modifiers arrange arbitrary
  children without claiming a structural region. FormLayout owns field-specific
  arrangement and optionality. Card is a discrete-item surface. AppShell owns
  page-shell and navigation semantics rather than this reusable region grammar.
  Table owns structured data, and Divider owns separation; their participation
  in `architecture:container-padding` does not make either a layout-region
  member.

A component does not join because it happens to render a flex row, a padded
wrapper, or a header-like visual treatment.

## Shared owner

- Section owns the generic painted page/content region, including its variant,
  selected divider edges, component padding, and nested Section behavior.
- Layout owns its five-slot topology, slot presence, region position, shared
  outer/inner inset, height mode, content-width propagation, and default
  header/footer divider context. It does not own the page shell.
- LayoutHeader, LayoutContent, LayoutFooter, and LayoutPanel own their region
  element, optional landmark role/name, local padding, and region-specific size
  or scrolling behavior.
- Toolbar owns the contextual action region, its start/center/end lanes,
  toolbar semantics, keyboard movement, and size cascade. It delegates its
  painted surface, variant, and selected divider edges to Section.
- `architecture:container-padding` owns inherited inset and bleed mechanics.
- useResizable and ResizeHandle own resize state and interaction. LayoutPanel
  only accepts their current size as an alternative width owner.

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| generic region        | Section                                                             | Related page/content area with an optional painted treatment                | current                |

| region scroll         | clipped, scrollable, or page-owned where exposed                    | LayoutContent and LayoutPanel own their current overflow choice             | component-owned        |

| region size           | intrinsic, fixed, fill/auto, capped, or resize-driven where exposed | Each member owns its applicable size axis                                   | component-owned        |
| responsive adaptation | retained, omitted, or replaced by caller composition                | No shared automatic region swap exists                                      | caller/component-owned |

## Cross-component invariants

- **FR1 — A region owns structure, not product meaning.** A member establishes a
  spatial boundary and renders caller content without adopting the content's
  product semantics, state, or component contracts.
- **FR2 — Region direction is logical.** Start and end follow writing direction.
  Divider placement and panel adjacency use the same logical region position.
- **FR3 — Layout selects geometry from slot presence.** Header, Content, Footer,
  and Panel apply outer inset where they touch the Layout boundary and inner
  inset where they meet another region. LayoutContent keeps its root as the
  scroll, padding, and direct-child owner. Omitted slots do not leave an area
  wrapper. The inherited geometry republished to full-bleed descendants is
  subject to the current LayoutContent/LayoutPanel conformance gap in
  `architecture:container-padding`.
- **FR4 — Explicit region padding replaces the automatic applied inset.**
  Section publishes its component inset; Layout distributes outer and inner
  inset across its named slots; a region's explicit padding or zero-padding
  path selects its local styles. This does not claim that every automatic
  Layout edge currently republishes an exact matching descendant variable.
- **FR5 — Boundary ownership is caller-selected where composition permits two
  owners.** LayoutHeader and LayoutFooter each own their implied edge. Section
  and Toolbar expose selected edges. LayoutPanel may draw its content-facing
  edge, and ResizeHandle may also draw it; current code does not prevent both.
  A resizable panel composition must set `LayoutPanel hasDivider={false}` when
  the adjacent ResizeHandle owns the divider.
- **FR6 — Divider absence may change spacing.** Layout regions currently collapse
  the interior spacing associated with an absent header, footer, or panel
  divider; an explicit divider preserves the fenced boundary.
- **FR7 — Scrolling is explicit and local.** LayoutContent and LayoutPanel own
  their current `isScrollable` behavior. Section and Toolbar do not become
  scroll containers through family membership. Layout `height="fill"` contains
  region scrolling; `height="auto"` lets the containing page grow.
- **FR8 — Landmark semantics remain explicit.** Named visual placement does not
  automatically assign `banner`, `main`, `navigation`, `complementary`, or
  `contentinfo`. A caller supplies a supported role and label for the context.
- **FR9 — Responsive substitution is not automatic.** Section and Toolbar keep
  their current presentation. Layout renders the regions supplied by the
  caller. AppShell, product composition, or another component-specific owner
  decides when a region is omitted or replaced at a narrower width.
- **FR10 — Resize ownership remains delegated.** A LayoutPanel with `resizable`
  uses the hook-provided current size instead of its `width` prop. The region
  family does not redefine snapping, persistence, collapse, keyboard, or pointer
  behavior.
- **FR11 — Theming remains component-owned.** Structural membership does not
  create family targets. Current `.doc.mjs` metadata documents shipped targets
  and capabilities, runtime `themeProps()` emits them, and
  `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns the cross-component rules. A
  component spec may add optional anatomy-mapping metadata when one exists.
- **FR12 — Content width keeps the scrollbar at the open content edge.** When
  `contentWidth` is set without panels, LayoutContent spans the available middle
  area and aligns its direct children through context-aware inline insets. With
  exactly one panel, that panel stays aligned to the centered frame while
  LayoutContent extends through the opposite open side. The mirrored start/end
  cases use the same rule. With both panels, the complete middle composition
  stays constrained. Percentage and intrinsic width values, plus bare variables,
  keep the constrained composition because they cannot safely share one alignment
  basis; `calc(var(...))` is the explicit length-valued variable path.

## Allowed component variation

- **AV1 — Region strength.** Section is a generic region; Layout members are
  position-aware slots in the five-slot primitive; Toolbar is a semantic action
  bar.
- **AV2 — Surface treatment.** Section and Toolbar may use Section variants and
  selected edges. Layout regions use their existing divider and padding
  treatments. Family membership does not unify their visual API.
- **AV3 — Region content.** Header, footer, panel, content, and toolbar lanes may
  hold any content allowed by their component contracts.
- **AV4 — Size model.** Layout owns fill/auto container height and content-width
  propagation; individual regions own applicable height, width, padding, and
  scroll props; Section owns its box-size props.
- **AV5 — Interaction.** Toolbar owns roving focus and keyboard hints. Other
  members add no toolbar behavior. Resizable owns resize interaction.
- **AV6 — Composition mechanism.** Members may use Stack utilities, direct CSS
  layout, contexts, or component composition. The observable region contract is
  the owned surface.
- **AV7 — Responsive policy.** Callers may omit, replace, or externally adapt
  regions. The family sets no breakpoint.

| LayoutPanel / fixed or resize-driven             | Panel position selects edge treatment                           | useResizable may replace width ownership; ResizeHandle retains interaction ownership                                              |
| Toolbar / two or three lanes                     | Contextual action region delegates its surface to Section       | Center content switches internal arrangement; toolbar alone owns keyboard behavior                                                |

These rows describe shipped behavior and verification gaps. They are not approved
exceptions to silently change in a documentation pull request.

## Change coupling

- Adding or changing a structural-region component checks membership and updates
  this contract only when the shared boundary changes.
- Changing Layout slot presence, area context, inset distribution, divider
  inheritance, height mode, or content-width propagation updates the
  corresponding region tests and browser evidence.
- Changing Section padding, nested escape, variant, or divider behavior updates
  its component contract and reviews `architecture:container-padding` when
  inherited geometry changes.
- Changing Toolbar lanes, semantics, keyboard behavior, or size cascade remains
  Toolbar work; changing its Section-backed surface or inset relationship also
  reviews this family and the container-padding architecture.
- Changing LayoutPanel resize integration reviews Resizable's component contract
  without copying resize mechanics into this family.
- Adding responsive hide/swap behavior requires a component or higher-level
  owner and compatibility evidence; family membership does not authorize a new
  breakpoint prop.

The current tests prove selected structure, attributes, callbacks, and class/style
branches. They do not prove one computed visual alignment across every Section,
Layout, Toolbar, and ResizeHandle composition; the adoption table names those
limits explicitly.

## Decision links

### DEC-1 — Structural regions and composition primitives have separate owners

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-30`

Section, Layout and its named regions, and Toolbar form the layout-regions
family. Stack, Grid, Center, and their modifiers have a separate
layout-primitives owner. This keeps shared region rules focused on structural
boundaries without turning every flex/grid container into a page region.

### DEC-2 — AppShell owns the page shell

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-31`

AppShell owns the page shell and application-navigation composition. Layout is
the general five-slot primitive used to arrange `header`, `start`, `content`,
`end`, and `footer` regions within a page or bounded container. The broader
container-padding participants retain their own component ownership.

### DEC-3 — Content-only width alignment stays inside the content scrollport

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-09`

When `contentWidth` is set without panels, LayoutContent spans the available
middle area and aligns its direct children through context-aware inline insets.
With exactly one panel, that panel remains aligned to the centered frame while
LayoutContent extends through the opposite open side. Logical start and end
mirror. With both panels, or when the width is percentage-based, intrinsic, or
an unresolved bare variable and cannot safely share one CSS arithmetic basis, the
complete middle composition stays constrained. A guaranteed length-valued
variable uses `calc(var(...))` to opt into edge scrolling.

## Open questions

None. The adoption table contains checkable source and browser work, not
unresolved family policy.

## Content boundary

This record owns only shared structural-region behavior. It does not repeat
component prop tables, define arbitrary-child composition, own product or
navigation semantics, prescribe visual design, assign responsive breakpoints,
redefine resize interaction, or own component theming anatomy and targets.
