# Input field family contract

## Intent

A person should encounter one coherent input system: state display, behavior,
appearance, and size use consistent treatment and API contracts across members.
Each component still owns the interaction model specific to the value it edits.

This record separates normative family requirements from shipped facts. The
frontmatter `verified_by` list names representative evidence anchors rather than
every member suite. The membership list and adoption table are exhaustive for
the current family; changes to any member still require its focused evidence.

## Membership rule

A component belongs when its primary public purpose is collecting or editing a
form value through a labeled field surface with a content lane. Members use
`Field` semantics or own an equivalent field shell and can participate in
`FormLayout`.

- **Members:** TextInput, TextArea, NumberInput, DateInput, DateRangeInput,
  DateTimeInput, TimeInput, FileInput, Selector, MultiSelector,
  ComplexSelector, Typeahead, and Tokenizer.
- **Collaborators:** Field and FieldStatus provide shared field chrome;
  FormLayout arranges fields; InputGroup groups members that explicitly adopt its
  capability contract; InputClearButton, Spinner, Tooltip, and BaseTypeahead provide
  shared affordance or interaction behavior. These collaborators are not members.
- **Excluded:** CheckboxInput, RadioList, Switch, and Slider use labeled-control
  models without this content/end-lane geometry. PowerSearch and ChatComposer
  are higher-level compositions that consume member behavior rather than define
  another field primitive. BaseTypeahead is a combobox engine without a field
  surface.

Membership follows public responsibility, not use of `inputWrapperStyles` or
another implementation helper.

## Shared owner

- This family owns the consistent cross-component treatment and API contract for
  input state display, behavior, appearance, and size. Sizing and end-control
  geometry are invariants within that broader purpose, not the purpose itself.
- `Field` owns the standalone label, description, status placement, and explicit
  `width` seam. A member omits its nested Field when a supported InputGroup owns
  the group label and supporting text.
- `FormLayout` owns outer arrangement, spacing, direction, and form-level
  optionality. It does not redefine a member's internal control geometry.
- `InputGroup` owns the fixed row height, connected outer surface, edge alignment,
  and group-level focus presentation for admitted children. Admission follows the
  capability contract in FR3, not a permanent component allowlist; input-family
  membership alone does not imply support.
- Each admitted member owns the grouped adaptation that satisfies FR3. Ungrouped
  presentation and behavior remain component-owned and unchanged by admission.
  End controls may be ordinary flex items or a component-local lane; this family
  does not require one shared wrapper, measurement hook, target, custom property,
  or new public prop.
- Shared primitives retain their own visual and accessibility ownership. In
  particular, InputClearButton, Spinner, Tooltip, FieldStatus, and Icon do not
  become member-specific APIs when composed into a field.
- FieldStatus owns its direct `attached` and `detached` message-box
  presentations. Field owns composition with an input: it consumes `tooltip`
  before rendering FieldStatus and applies the member's supported placement
  contract.

## Cross-component invariants

- **FR1 — Inline size is stable across ordinary field states.** In the same
  containing layout, a member MUST NOT change its outer available inline size
  merely because placeholder content becomes a value, or because a busy,
  status, or clear control appears. Explicit `width`, parent layout, and
  responsive constraints still apply. Standalone Selector is the DEC-1
  exception and may follow its displayed content.
- **FR2 — Rendered end controls own non-overlapping space.** Text, tokens, the
  caret, and selected content MUST NOT paint or receive pointer input underneath
  a clear action, Spinner, status control, disclosure, or component-owned end
  content. A lane that is absent MUST NOT leave stale or unexplained space.
  This is an observable requirement, not a mandate for measurement or a shared
  lane primitive.
- **FR3 — InputGroup admission requires a complete grouped adaptation.** Any input
  member MAY participate when its owning component explicitly adopts grouped mode
  and proves all of the following: it resolves a compatible control height and size
  from the group; removes or suppresses competing outer Field, border, radius, and
  surface geometry; delegates the connected outer border, radius, and group-level
  focus presentation coherently; keeps content within the single-row group geometry
  through component-owned truncation, folding, clipping, or overflow; and preserves
  the input's accessible name and description, value semantics, keyboard behavior,
  focus behavior, and editing or selection model. Admission follows these
  capabilities rather than a permanent allowlist. Family membership or context
  consumption alone is insufficient.
- **FR4 — Disabled reasons remain reachable where supported.** When a member
  exposes `disabledMessage`, the inactive field remains focusable enough to
  expose the reason while editing, selection, and activation stay blocked.
  Components without that public concept are not required to add it.
- **FR5 — Input loading describes the value, not supporting data.** Where a
  member exposes `isLoading`, it means the field value is resolving or being
  saved. It MUST NOT make independently supplied options unavailable or change
  a data-source prop's contract. Initial option-source pending is the separate
  explicit state required by AST-001.
- **FR6 — Transition Actions preserve immediate feedback.** Where a member
  exposes `changeAction`, every documented value-change path runs `onChange`
  first, presents the proposed controlled value optimistically, runs
  `changeAction` in a React transition, and contributes to the same busy
  presentation until the controlled value accepts or replaces it.
- **FR7 — Component-owned source work keeps family geometry and accessibility.**
  Typeahead and Tokenizer own asynchronous search state through BaseTypeahead,
  not through the family `isLoading` meaning. Their visible source-busy feedback
  still MUST be named, expose busy semantics on the combobox, and satisfy FR1,
  FR2, and FR3 where grouped.
- **FR8 — Status placement follows member capability.** Every input MUST offer
  `detached` and `tooltip`. A member supports `attached` only when its direct
  control is opaque, bordered, fixed-height, and its owning root reliably
  reflects the resolved size used for overlap. Where supported, `attached` is
  the default. Wrapped, custom, tall, or translucent surfaces normally use
  `detached` or a component-owned placement. Direct FieldStatus continues to
  support only `attached` and `detached`; Field consumes `tooltip` before
  rendering it.
- **FR9 — The focus-zoom floor is iOS-specific.** A text-entry control that uses
  the family focus-zoom guard MUST resolve its editable text to at least 16 CSS
  px on the supported iOS touch path. Android, desktop touch, and other non-iOS
  coarse-pointer environments MUST keep the active theme's type scale rather
  than inheriting the iOS floor. The platform-detection mechanism remains an
  implementation detail, but it MUST preserve those observable outcomes.

## Allowed component variation

- **AV1 — Native versus composed control.** Text fields may use native inputs;
  selection controls may use button/listbox or dialog composition.
- **AV2 — End-control mechanism and meaning.** A member may use in-flow flex
  items or a component-local out-of-flow lane and may render clear, busy,
  status, disclosure, stepper, or documented custom content. The mechanism does
  not weaken FR1 or FR2.
- **AV3 — Block-axis growth and grouped adaptation.** TextArea and Tokenizer may
  grow in the block axis for multiline or multi-token content while ungrouped.
  InputGroup admission does not change those standalone defaults. In grouped mode,
  an admitted component owns a presentation that satisfies FR3. Tokenizer is
  admitted on that basis and, when the caller does not choose another supported
  overflow mode, MUST default to a component-owned overflow treatment that preserves
  the group's single-line appearance. This grouped default does not require a new
  public prop or theme target.
- **AV4 — Action callback shape.** Text-editing members may pass their change
  event to `changeAction`; structured-value members may pass only the proposed
  value. Component docs own the exact callback type.
- **AV5 — Supported concepts vary.** A member need not add `size`, `isLoading`,
  `changeAction`, `disabledMessage`, clear, or InputGroup support merely to join
  the family. When it exposes one of those concepts, the matching family rule
  applies.
- **AV6 — Attached-status support.** A member that cannot satisfy FR8 keeps
  attached unavailable rather than approximating the overlap. It still offers
  detached and tooltip through the family status contract.
- **AV7 — Platform detection.** Implementations may use any supported capability
  test that identifies the iOS touch path without applying the floor to non-iOS
  coarse pointers. This contract does not require a particular CSS query,
  browser string, or shared helper.

The current text-entry controls that already carry a 16px anti-zoom floor apply it
only on iOS. This includes input-family members and the existing shared or
higher-level text-entry collaborators covered by the family-wide source guard;
DEC-6 does not require unrelated components to add a new floor.

### Implementation gaps

- **Typeahead state geometry:** current main removes the intrinsic-width input
  from layout when a selected Token is shown, so a content-sized parent can
  collapse the field onto the value. Its clear control is separately positioned,
  and current source-busy feedback is an in-flow static clock without
  `aria-busy`; selected, source-busy, and grouped combinations do not have the
  focused geometry coverage required by FR1–FR3 and FR7. PRs
  [#5555](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/5555) and
  [#5682](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/5682) document attempted
  implementations and are non-authoritative evidence. Any implementation keeps its
  DOM/CSS mechanism component-owned and must be reviewed against this contract at
  its exact head.
- **Tokenizer state geometry and grouped admission:** current main positions
  `endContent` and clear controls out of flow without reserving their rendered
  width, so narrow input content can pass underneath them. Token count can also
  change intrinsic inline size. PR #5555 is non-authoritative evidence of an
  attempted component-local reserve. Tokenizer is not InputGroup-compatible on
  current main; DEC-5 admits it once its grouped path satisfies FR3 and defaults to
  a single-line overflow treatment without changing ungrouped behavior. [#4405](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/4405)
  is implementation evidence to review against that authority, not a Tokenizer-only
  exception or authority by itself.
- **Selector source-state semantics:** Selector and MultiSelector keep provided
  options available while input `isLoading` is true, but current empty/no-result
  presentation still treats that flag as option-source pending and neither
  component has the explicit source-pending API required by AST-001.
- **Transition Action coverage:** current TextInput and FileInput clear
  affordances call `onChange` without `changeAction`, and FileInput does not
  explicitly hold the proposed controlled files as an optimistic value while
  its Action is pending. Other exposed clear paths inspected on current main
  route through their ordinary Action pipeline. These are conformance gaps
  under FR6, not alternate family semantics.
- **Status placement conformance:** current Field defaults attached for arbitrary
  children without proving the control satisfies FR8. TextArea, Tokenizer, and
  FileInput's dropzone are representative tall, wrapped, or custom surfaces that
  cannot inherit attached solely from the shared default. Some member docs also
  omit tooltip or the whole status-placement projection even though Field
  consumes the family sentinel. Follow-up work must make attached capability and
  the three input-level choices accurate in each member's API and docs.
- **Attached FieldStatus overlap:** attached placement is limited to eligible
  members whose direct control and owning root reliably expose resolved size.
  Eligible members preserve attached placement; unsupported wrapped, custom, tall,
  and translucent surfaces retain component-owned placement, normally detached.
  [PR #5769](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/5769) is non-authoritative
  evidence of an attempted implementation that derives overlap from a descendant
  `data-size`; that mechanism does not by itself establish eligibility or root-size
  ownership.
- **Verification coverage:** current unit tests prove composition, semantics, and
  individual state behavior, but do not yet provide the complete real-browser
  inline-size/end-overlap matrix below. This current record names those
  implementation gaps rather than claiming they are already fixed.

The verification map names representative evidence, not every member suite.
The exhaustive coverage obligation follows the membership and adoption tables.

## Decision links

### DEC-1 — Selector is the standalone inline-size exception

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-30`

Selector belongs to the input-field family, but a standalone Selector may size
with its displayed placeholder or selected value. This exception does not remove
constraints imposed by FormLayout, a supported InputGroup, or explicit product
layout.

### DEC-2 — Input loading describes value resolution or saving

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-30`

For members that expose `isLoading`, it describes the field value resolving or
being saved. It does not mean option or supporting data is loading. Data-source
props keep their normal contract while the value is busy.

`spec:AST-001/DEC-1` and `spec:AST-001/DEC-2` apply that distinction to Selector
and MultiSelector: provided options stay available, zero options is a no-choice
state, and initial option-source pending must be explicit.

### DEC-3 — Transition Actions are an input-family contract

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-30`

The optional `changeAction` API and its optimistic/pending behavior belong to the
input family. Component docs own each value and event type, but members do not
independently redefine callback ordering, optimistic feedback, or busy-state
semantics.

Public API admission remains owned by `spec:AST-002/DEC-1`; this family adds no
separate invalid-state or API-guardrail policy.

### DEC-4 — Attached status is conditional capability, not universal geometry

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-31`

Every input offers detached and tooltip status placement. A member offers
attached only when its direct control is opaque, bordered, fixed-height, and its
owning root reliably reflects the resolved size used for overlap. Attached is the
default whenever it is supported. Wrapped, custom, tall, or translucent surfaces
normally use detached or retain component-owned placement.

Direct FieldStatus remains limited to attached and detached presentation. Tooltip
is an input-family composition that Field consumes before rendering FieldStatus.

Rejected: deriving universal attached overlap from any descendant `data-size`,
because descendant metadata does not prove the direct surface is opaque,
bordered, fixed-height, or the owner of that resolved size.

### DEC-5 — InputGroup admission is capability-based

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-09`

InputGroup compatibility is not a closed component allowlist. Any input-family
member may participate when its component contract and implementation explicitly
adopt grouped mode and satisfy FR3: compatible resolved size and control height, no
competing outer Field or surface geometry, coherent connected border/radius/focus
ownership, single-row group geometry, and unchanged input semantics and keyboard
behavior.

Tokenizer is admitted under this rule. Its ungrouped wrapping and overflow defaults
remain unchanged. In grouped mode, when no supported overflow mode is selected by
the caller, Tokenizer defaults to a component-owned treatment that preserves the
group's single-line appearance. The implementation may reuse its existing overflow
surface; this decision adds no public prop, callback, theme target, or generic
InputGroup branch.

Rejected: a permanent hard-coded allowlist, a Tokenizer-only exception, allowing
context consumption without a complete grouped adaptation, or forcing standalone
multiline/multi-token inputs into single-line presentation.

### DEC-6 — The 16px focus-zoom floor applies only on iOS

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-20`

Text-entry controls that carry the anti-zoom safeguard resolve editable text to at
least 16 CSS px on the supported iOS touch path. Other coarse-pointer platforms
keep the active theme's type scale because they do not share the iOS focus-zoom
behavior this safeguard addresses.

The contract owns the observable platform outcomes, not a particular feature
query or source pattern. Existing shared and higher-level text-entry surfaces may
reuse the family rule without becoming input-family members, and this decision
does not require unrelated controls to adopt a new floor.

Rejected: applying the 16px floor to every coarse pointer. Pointer precision does
not establish the iOS browser behavior and inflates text on Android and
input-capable touch laptops without preventing a corresponding zoom failure.

## Open questions

None.

## Content boundary

This record owns only cross-component field behavior. Component props,
selection/search algorithms, visual target maps, implementation mechanisms,
current audit results, and product-specific compositions remain with their
component, architecture, design, audit, or callsite owners.
