## Intent

People who depend on assistive technology should get the AT-specific focus and announcement outcome Astryx claims, not only plausible test-DOM markup. Astryx uses real AT/browser checks when that outcome depends on how AT exposes or announces focus, AT-specific focus order, announcement behavior, virtual-cursor entry, or a known AT/browser divergence.

These checks are targeted, not universal. Semantic changes may merge to `main` with the strongest other evidence that proves their claims. A stable release waits only when this spec requires named real AT/browser evidence and that evidence is pending, failed, or expired.

## Non-goals

This spec does not:

- require every accessibility change to run every assistive technology or every browser;
- treat real AT as a substitute for unit, DOM, accessibility-tree, axe, or browser tests that prove different claims more precisely;
- define consumer accessibility requirements or claim conformance with an entire accessibility standard from one tool or matrix;
- require a stable announcement transcript when an AT intentionally changes harmless wording but keeps the required information and order;
- implement release automation, contribution forms, labels, bots, fixtures, or test infrastructure in this specification pull request; or
- copy this policy into contributor or release guidance before those separately owned records exist.

### Authority boundary

AST-009 supersedes the public [Accessibility Checklist](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/wiki/Accessibility-Checklist) only for real-AT trigger classification, evidence boundaries, durable receipts, exceptions, revalidation, and stable-release blocks. The checklist remains the consumer and contributor bar for component accessibility requirements.

AST-009 does not own focus-ring appearance, interaction-modality behavior, visual or contrast methodology, browser support, component theming, or overlay behavior. Those stay with [interaction modality](../../architecture/interaction-modality.md), [browser support](../AST-013/spec.md), [component theming](../../architecture/component-theming-surface.md), [theme tokens](../../architecture/theme-tokens.md), [layer runtime](../../architecture/layer-runtime.md), [overlay dismissal](../../families/overlay-dismissal.md), and the owning component records.

## Requirements

### Verification triggers

| ID  | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR1 | The gate follows the claimed user outcome. Real AT/browser evidence is required only when the intended outcome depends on AT-specific behavior: how AT exposes or announces focus, AT-specific focus order, spoken/braille output, browse or virtual-cursor behavior, mode changes, or a known AT/browser divergence. A semantic code change or focus-only browser behavior is not the trigger; the trigger is an AT-dependent claim that cannot be proved below the real-AT layer.                                                                                           |
| FR2 | Focus changes trigger only for AT-specific outcomes. Real AT/browser verification is required when the claim depends on how AT exposes, announces, or orders programmatic, initial, restored, composite, or after-dismissal focus. Focus destination, order, return, keyboard operation, focus-ring styling, a refactor preserving the same browser focus target, or a static `tabIndex` correction does not trigger by itself. The owning component and [interaction-modality record](../../architecture/interaction-modality.md) define those browser and visual behaviors. |
| FR3 | Role, name, and description changes trigger when announcement or mode is the outcome. A computed role, accessible name, or description may be proved by accessibility-tree evidence when the claim ends at browser exposure. Real AT/browser verification is additionally required when the change relies on that semantic being announced during entry or a state transition, changing interaction/browse mode, or resolving a known AT/browser divergence.                                                                                                                  |
| FR4 | Announcement content and timing trigger directly. A live region, status message, alert, validation announcement, loading/completion transition, or other spoken/braille update requires real AT/browser evidence when success depends on what is announced, its order, when it occurs, whether it repeats, or whether it is skipped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| FR5 | Virtual-cursor entry triggers directly. Opening, navigation, or focus behavior requires real AT/browser evidence when success depends on where screen-reader browse or virtual cursor enters, whether content is discoverable from that entry point, or whether the user can move between browse and interaction modes. Ordinary keyboard Tab order with no browse-mode claim does not trigger this requirement.                                                                                                                                                              |
| FR6 | Known divergence keeps the gate active. A changed pattern with a recorded AT/browser divergence requires checks for every named side of that divergence until an owner records that the divergence no longer applies. A passing result from one side does not stand in for another known to differ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| FR7 | Untriggered changes use proportionate evidence. Static semantics, keyboard behavior, color/contrast, target size, source order, and similar accessibility changes use the least expensive evidence layer that directly proves the claim. They do not acquire a real-AT gate merely because they are accessibility work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| FR8 | Classification is explicit. The change record states which trigger applies, or states why none applies and names the evidence layer that proves the intended outcome. Silence is not a classification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### What each evidence layer proves

This table bounds claims only when classifying real-AT triggers under AST-009. It does not replace evidence required by current component, family, browser-support, visual, theming, or audit records.

Each layer is bounded. Passing one layer MUST NOT be described as proving a claim assigned to a later layer.

| Evidence           | It proves                                                                                                                                                           | It does not prove                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit               | State derivation, branch selection, callback effects, application-owned ordering, and deterministic regressions.                                                    | Browser focus navigation, accessibility API exposure, or AT output.                                                              |
| DOM                | Rendered elements, attributes, ownership markers, source order, and author-supplied ARIA relationships in the tested state.                                         | Computed accessible name/description, platform accessibility mapping, speech, browse mode, or real browser event behavior.       |
| Accessibility tree | The browser's computed role, name, description, state, relationships, and focused accessible node for the tested engine.                                            | What an AT announces, announcement timing/order, virtual-cursor placement, or behavior in another engine/platform stack.         |
| axe                | Rules the configured axe version can mechanically detect in the rendered states it was given.                                                                       | Absence of all accessibility defects, task usability, correct focus destination, complete announcements, or AT interoperability. |
| Real browser       | Actual focus destination/order/return, keyboard and pointer behavior, browser event timing, native semantics, and engine-specific state transitions.                | Speech/braille output, browse or virtual-cursor entry, or AT-specific divergence.                                                |
| Real AT/browser    | Observed speech/braille content and order, announcement timing/repetition, browse or virtual-cursor entry, mode transitions, and named AT/browser interoperability. | Untested pairings, future versions, or claims outside the recorded scenario.                                                     |

| ID   | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR9  | Evidence composes by claim. A triggered change normally keeps its lower-layer evidence and adds real AT/browser checks only for claims those checks can prove. Real AT observation MUST NOT replace deterministic regression coverage for behavior the lower layers own.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| FR10 | The tested state is the claimed state. Evidence exercises the transition or state that carries the user outcome, such as opening the surface, moving focus, producing the status update, dismissing and restoring focus, or entering with the virtual cursor. A static baseline that merely contains the component is insufficient.                                                                                                                 |
| FR11 | Real means the shipping pairing. A real-AT check runs the named assistive technology against the named shipping browser on its supported operating system. A virtual machine, remote machine, or simulator is acceptable only when it runs that actual pairing and preserves the input/mode under test. A DOM emulator, accessibility snapshot, synthetic speech stub, or browser engine standing in for a branded browser is not real-AT evidence. |

### Representative matrix

The matrix is selected from the outcome and supported platform, not copied in full onto every change.

| Representative pairing       | Use when the outcome includes                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NVDA + Chrome on Windows     | Browser-neutral desktop AT-specific focus exposure/order or announcement behavior on the Chromium/Windows stack.      |
| VoiceOver + Safari on macOS  | Browser-neutral desktop AT-specific focus exposure/order or announcement behavior on the Safari/macOS platform stack. |
| NVDA + Firefox on Windows    | Gecko-specific behavior or a named NVDA Chrome/Firefox divergence.                                                    |
| VoiceOver + Safari on iOS    | Touch-driven iOS behavior, mobile Safari, rotor/browse navigation, or iOS-specific divergence.                        |
| TalkBack + Chrome on Android | Touch-driven Android behavior, Android virtual navigation, or Android-specific divergence.                            |

| ID   | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FR12 | Desktop-neutral AT-specific focus exposure/order or announcement claims use two independent stacks: at least NVDA + Chrome on Windows and VoiceOver + Safari on macOS. A platform-specific claim uses its matching pairing only unless FR14 expands it.                                                |
| FR13 | Mobile claims use a matching mobile stack. A mobile or touch/virtual-cursor outcome uses at least one matching mobile pairing. Both iOS and Android are required only when the claim covers both and platform-specific code, behavior, or recorded evidence gives reason to expect different outcomes. |
| FR14 | Divergence expands rather than replaces. Every side named in a known divergence is included even when that adds a pairing beyond FR12 or FR13.                                                                                                                                                         |
| FR15 | Versions and modes are part of the matrix. The receipt names OS, AT, browser, input mode, and material settings or verbosity that affect the result. “Screen reader checked” or a browser name without its AT is not a matrix.                                                                         |
| FR16 | Representative does not mean exhaustive. Passing the selected matrix supports only the recorded outcome and pairings. It does not claim every AT, browser, verbosity setting, locale, or input method behaves identically.                                                                             |

### Stable-release lifecycle

| ID   | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| FR17 | Merge and stable release are separate gates. When intended user impact depends on AT-specific focus exposure/order, announcement or virtual-cursor behavior, or a known AT/browser divergence under FR2–FR6, the implementation may merge to `main` once the otherwise-required evidence from the owning records passes, its real-AT matrix and scenario are named, and a durable release-block record exists. Preview and prerelease builds may carry the pending change. The first stable release containing it MUST NOT publish while the block is pending, failed, or expired. |
| FR18 | The block follows the shipped change. It identifies the source pull request and commit, the first affected stable release or release line when known, each required matrix row, and each row state: `pending`, `pass`, `fail`, `excepted`, or `invalidated`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| FR19 | Only passes or a current exception clear the block. Every required row must have a passing receipt bound to an applicable build, or be covered by an unexpired owner-recorded exception. Missing, failed, and invalidated rows continue to block the stable release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| FR20 | Failures remain findings. A failed observation records the user impact and linked fix. The affected row is retested against the fixed build. Unrelated passing rows remain usable unless the fix could affect them. Editing an expected result to match an undesirable observation does not turn failure into pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| FR21 | Receipts remain valid until invalidated. A passing receipt may be reused for later stable releases while the tested semantic, focus, announcement, virtual-cursor, or divergence-sensitive path and relevant support claim remain unchanged. Revalidation is required after a material change to that path or fixture, a fix for the observed behavior, a newly recorded divergence that affects the matrix, or an explicit receipt/exception expiry. Unrelated commits do not invalidate evidence.                                                                                |
| FR22 | Revalidation decisions are recorded. When a later build differs from the tested commit, the release record either links the material revalidation receipt or records why the difference cannot affect the tested path. The latter is applicability review, not a new AT pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Exceptions and expiry

| ID   | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR23 | Exceptions are explicit owner decisions. Only a listed owner of this spec may authorize release without a required pass. Absence of equipment, schedule pressure, a green axe run, or prior behavior does not imply an exception.                                                                                                                                 |
| FR24 | Exceptions are narrow and finite. An exception names the exact change, stable release or release line, omitted or failed matrix rows, accepted user risk, compensating evidence or mitigation, owner, decision date, and an expiry date or release boundary. A release-scoped exception authorizes only that named release; it does not become a standing waiver. |
| FR25 | Expiry restores the block. At the earliest recorded expiry, invalidating behavior change, newly applicable divergence, or end of the named release scope, the row returns to `pending` or `invalidated`. A later stable release needs a pass or a new owner decision with current risk information.                                                               |
| FR26 | Exceptions do not rewrite evidence. An excepted row remains visibly excepted rather than pass. The follow-up check or fix remains linked until it produces a passing receipt or the affected behavior is removed.                                                                                                                                                 |

| FR27 | The textual receipt is durable and public. The canonical receipt lives in the merged pull request, a linked public tracking issue, or a repository-owned record. It MUST remain readable without access to expiring CI artifacts, private systems, or an unversioned local file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| FR28 | Every receipt is reproducible. It records the source pull request and commit or tested build identifier; stable story, fixture, route, or exact reproduction steps; trigger and contract claim under test; expected focus destination, semantics, announcement, timing, or virtual-cursor outcome; OS, AT, browser, and relevant settings/versions; input sequence and starting state; observed result, including announcement transcript or focus/cursor destination when applicable; `pass` or `fail`, tester, and date; and linked defect, follow-up, exception, and attachments when applicable. |
| FR29 | Text carries the decision-critical facts. Screenshots, recordings, speech logs, and CI artifacts may supplement the receipt. They MUST NOT be the only place that records the matrix, expected outcome, observation, result, or exception. Evidence must contain no private user data or internal-only links.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| FR30 | Reusable scenarios live with the code. When a scenario will be used for release revalidation or represents a component contract, its stable story or fixture is checked into the repository. A one-off external test page is not the sole reproduction path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| FR31 | Guidance projects this spec. Future contributor accessibility guidance must link to this spec for trigger classification, evidence bounds, and receipt requirements. Future release guidance must link to this spec for block, exception, expiry, and revalidation rules. Those guides may explain the current workflow but MUST NOT duplicate or redefine this policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Platform support

- Supported feature/engine floor: [AST-013](../AST-013/spec.md) and the affected component or package own browser support. This matrix selects AT/browser evidence rows within that support claim.
- Unsupported behavior: no passing claim is made for an untested unsupported pairing; a known supported-pairing divergence follows FR6 and FR14.
- Browser evidence: Playwright or another real-browser runner may prove browser behavior and accessibility-tree exposure. It does not satisfy the real-AT rows unless the actual named assistive technology is operating against the named browser.

## Current-state impact

### Initial release block — pull request #5373

| Field              | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Source change      | Pull request [#5373](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/5373), merged as `1917581938200c3e56527bf4cda6d5de78b492a5`, changed read-only Popover initial focus so the labeled dialog container receives focus when no content control is available. |
| Affected release   | The first stable release containing that commit. Current candidate: draft release [PR #5789](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/5789) for v0.5.3. If another release becomes first, update this row before clearing the block.                    |
| Trigger            | FR2 and FR3. The intended result depends on the focused role and name being announced on entry.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Desktop scenario   | Open the `Read-only dialog focus` story, confirm the dialog name and role are announced at the focused container, then confirm the first Tab enters the dialog's control cycle rather than moving to unrelated content.                                |
| Touch/iOS scenario | On a physical iOS device with VoiceOver and Safari, open the same story by touch. Confirm the labeled dialog is announced at entry and touch or swipe navigation remains within the opened task before reaching unrelated page content.                |

Its merge-time unit, DOM, axe, and browser evidence from the owning records can support merging the semantic change. Because the intended outcome depends on what is announced at that focus destination, the first stable release waits for the receipts below or an explicit current exception. Existing axe and browser checks remain required where they prove assigned claims; neither clears an AT-triggered release block by itself.

| Required pairing            | State     |
| --------------------------- | --------- |
| NVDA + Chrome on Windows    | `pending` |
| VoiceOver + Safari on macOS | `pending` |
| VoiceOver + Safari on iOS   | `pending` |

All three rows block that stable release until they have passing durable receipts or are covered by a current owner-recorded exception. The iOS row covers #5373's touch path; iOS Simulator layout evidence does not prove VoiceOver or physical-device touch behavior.

The [Popover contract](../../../packages/core/src/Popover/Popover.spec.md), [layer runtime](../../architecture/layer-runtime.md), and [overlay dismissal](../../families/overlay-dismissal.md) continue to own focus, runtime, and dismissal behavior. AST-009 owns only the real-AT evidence and stable-release block for the claimed outcome.

This accepted spec creates no runtime or process implementation.

**Current enforcement status: missing.** No automated fail-closed check currently reads this block before publication. Implementing that check is non-blocking stack work for this documentation slice. Until it lands, this record states the required hold but does not itself prevent publication.

No current contributing record owns assistive-technology verification or the release hold. When those records are authored, they must link back to `spec:AST-009` rather than copying its policy; only then should their current identifiers be added to `affects_contributing`.

### Completion criteria

For an affected stable release, this accepted policy is satisfied only when:

- every included change has explicit trigger classification under FR8;
- each claim has evidence from the layer that can observe it under FR9–FR11;
- every triggered real-AT row clears through a complete applicable passing receipt under FR19 and FR28, or a current owner-recorded exception under FR23–FR26;
- pending, failed, invalidated, and expired rows still block release under FR17–FR22 and FR25; and
- canonical receipts and any exceptions remain durably linked from the change or release record under FR27–FR29.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Real AT verification is outcome-triggered, not category-wide

**Reference:** `spec:AST-009/DEC-1` · **Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-31`
**Decision:** FR1–FR8 require real AT/browser verification for AT-specific focus exposure/order, announcement behavior, virtual-cursor entry, or known divergence. Focus destination, keyboard behavior, focus appearance, and other accessibility changes use the evidence and authority that directly own their claim.
**User-impact rationale:** This proves AT-dependent outcomes without making unrelated changes run costly shallow checks. **Rejected:** requiring every accessibility change to run every AT.

### DEC-2 — Evidence layers keep distinct proof boundaries

**Reference:** `spec:AST-009/DEC-2` · **Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-31`
**Decision:** Unit, DOM, accessibility-tree, axe, browser, and real-AT evidence each prove a different boundary. Changes compose needed layers instead of treating one tool as general accessibility proof.
**User-impact rationale:** People must get the heard or navigated result, not only plausible markup or a green automated check. **Rejected:** accepting a green axe run, plausible ARIA, or an accessibility snapshot as proof of what a person hears or where their virtual cursor enters.

### DEC-3 — The real-AT matrix is representative and claim-specific

**Reference:** `spec:AST-009/DEC-3` · **Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-31`
**Decision:** Desktop-neutral AT-specific focus exposure/order and announcement claims use NVDA + Chrome on Windows and VoiceOver + Safari on macOS. Mobile, platform-specific, and known-divergent claims select or expand that matrix according to the affected outcome. Passing results make no universal compatibility claim.
**User-impact rationale:** The matrix covers the claim without implying untested AT, browser, verbosity, locale, or input behavior. **Rejected:** one fixed exhaustive matrix for every change, or one convenient pairing standing in for a stack already known to behave differently.

### DEC-4 — Pending AT evidence blocks stable release, not merge to main

**Reference:** `spec:AST-009/DEC-4` · **Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-31`
**Decision:** Under FR2–FR6, implementation may merge after the otherwise-required evidence from the owning records, plus a durable named follow-up. The first stable release remains blocked until the named real AT/browser matrix passes or a spec owner records a narrow, expiring exception.
**User-impact rationale:** Integration can proceed while stable users are protected from unverified AT-dependent outcomes. **Rejected:** holding every such change out of `main`, or releasing it stably on an unowned promise to test later.

### DEC-5 — Evidence and exceptions remain durable at the change boundary

**Reference:** `spec:AST-009/DEC-5` · **Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-31`
**Decision:** The change or linked release record carries reproducible textual receipts, applicable build identity, results, and finite exceptions. Expiring artifacts may supplement but cannot own the facts that clear the release block.
**User-impact rationale:** Future contributors and maintainers can audit why a release was allowed. **Rejected:** private notes, local files, or transient CI artifacts as the only release evidence.
