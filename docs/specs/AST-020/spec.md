# Accessibility spec-test authoring system spec

<!-- review-applicability:v1 -->

```json
{
  "scope": "global",
  "triggers": {
    "accessibility": ["FR1", "FR2", "FR6"]
  }
}
```

## Intent

People using Astryx components should get the keyboard, focus, meaning, and state
promised by [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and the
[WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) widget pattern
Astryx adopts. Reusable accessibility spec tests turn those promises into
reviewable contracts instead of requiring each component author to reinterpret
the standards.

A spec test states one user-observable requirement, cites its source, names the
evidence layer that can prove it, and runs unchanged against every conforming
binding. The test suite complements axe, browser checks, and assistive-technology
review. It does not claim that one automated pass proves complete accessibility.

## Non-goals

- Implementing the spec-test package or CI jobs in this specification pull request.
- Defining how existing component tests migrate; that is owned by
  [AST-021](../AST-021/spec.md).
- Publishing the first implementation as a supported package.
- Reimplementing axe rules or replacing browser, visual, manual, or real-AT
  verification.
- Treating WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices as a substitute for WCAG conformance.
- Using the WCAG 3.0 working draft as a pass/fail baseline before it is ready.
- Encoding page-owned requirements in an isolated component contract when the
  component cannot satisfy them.

## Requirements

### Normative basis and scope

- **FR1 — WCAG 2.2 A and AA are the conformance baseline.** Every WCAG
  conformance expectation MUST cite an applicable WCAG 2.2 Level A or AA success
  criterion. A pattern expectation MAY instead cite an exact APG requirement when
  APG supplies the interaction detail. In that case it MUST identify the WCAG 2.2
  user outcome it supports without inventing a success-criterion mapping. WCAG 3.0
  principles MAY inform plain-language intent, user needs, and future research, but
  a WCAG 3.0 draft requirement MUST NOT create or clear a pass/fail check without a
  later current Astryx record.
- **FR2 — APG defines an adopted widget pattern, not universal conformance.** When
  Astryx adopts a WAI-ARIA APG pattern, the pattern contract MUST cite the exact APG
  roles, states, properties, or keyboard interaction it adopts and the WCAG 2.2
  outcome those mechanics support. A component MAY use another standards-valid
  model only when its current component, family, or system contract records that
  choice; the spec test MUST follow the owning contract rather than forcing an APG
  example mechanically.
- **FR3 — Contracts have two layers.** Every pattern review MUST consider both:
  broad component-owned requirements that apply across patterns, and
  pattern-specific role, state, relationship, keyboard, and focus requirements.
  A component part may bind to more than one pattern. A whole component MUST NOT be
  forced into one pattern when its parts have distinct roles.

### Expectation contract

- **FR4 — Every expectation is traceable.** An expectation MUST have a stable id,
  a short user outcome, an exact normative source (WCAG 2.2 success criterion, APG
  requirement, current Astryx contract, or an applicable combination),
  applicability conditions, an evidence layer, and an enforcement class. The test
  name and failure output MUST expose the expectation id and source reference so a
  failure can be understood without opening the runner implementation.
- **FR5 — Applicability is explicit.** For every checklist dimension, an author
  MUST either encode an applicable expectation or record why the dimension is not
  owned by this pattern, binding, or evidence layer. Silence is not an exemption.
  An exemption MUST name the actual owner or verification method; it MUST NOT be a
  generic “not applicable” escape hatch.
- **FR6 — Evidence layers keep distinct proof boundaries.** Expectations are
  classified as unit, DOM, accessibility-tree, axe, real-browser, visual, lint,
  manual, or real-AT checks. A lower layer MUST NOT claim a result only a higher
  layer observes. Announcement wording or timing, virtual-cursor entry, and known
  AT/browser divergence follow [AST-009](../AST-009/spec.md); an accessibility-tree
  snapshot does not satisfy that real-AT contract.
- **FR7 — Contracts assert outcomes, not Astryx internals.** A reusable expectation
  MUST query and act through public semantics and observable behavior. It MUST NOT
  depend on Astryx class names, private DOM wrappers, implementation callbacks, or
  source layout unless an owning current record makes that structure contractual.
  Component-specific API effects remain in component tests.
- **FR8 — Interactive expectations prove the complete transition.** Keyboard,
  pointer, state, and focus expectations MUST exercise the relevant starting state,
  action, resulting state, and reverse or dismissal path when the pattern supports
  one. Merely finding a role or proving one direction of a toggle is insufficient.
- **FR9 — Enforcement is separate from severity and tool coverage.** A directly
  applicable WCAG 2.2 Level A or AA expectation is `required`. An APG or
  Astryx-specific expectation is `required` only when a current Astryx record adopts
  that outcome. `Advisory` expectations report best practice, an unsettled choice,
  or an outcome not yet adopted as an Astryx contract. `Advisory` expectations
  report only; `required` expectations gate new or changed behavior at a layer that
  can objectively verify them. A coverage score, tool capability, or ease of
  automation MUST NOT promote or demote either class.

### Completeness and review

- **FR10 — Every pattern uses one completeness review.** The review starts with
  the source map below, then adds applicable WCAG 2.2 component outcomes such as
  focus not obscured, status messages, target size, contrast, forced colors, and
  the pattern's APG interactions. Page-owned rows are considered only for fixtures
  or surfaces that own a page. Every row follows FR5 and FR6 rather than being
  forced into the reusable runtime contract.

- **FR11 — The contract itself has positive and negative proof.** Each expectation
  MUST pass against a minimally conforming fixture or binding and fail when its
  required outcome is deliberately removed. Pattern-level tests MUST distinguish a
  real violation from an unsupported harness operation or fixture error.
- **FR12 — Completion requires an independent accessibility review.** A pattern is
  complete only when every checklist dimension is encoded or explicitly assigned
  elsewhere, all expectations are traceable, representative bindings pass or expose
  exact known gaps, mutation evidence proves required expectations can fail, and an
  accessibility subject-matter reviewer finds no unaccounted contract-encodable
  requirement.
- **FR13 — The pull request describes the spec test in readable form.** A new or
  materially changed pattern pull request MUST state who is affected, the adopted
  pattern and scope, the expectation table with source and evidence layer, explicit
  exemptions, representative bindings and states, known component gaps, and the
  mutations or failures that prove the contract. The description is the readable
  specification of the test; the executable contract remains the checked source of
  truth.
- **FR14 — Stable ids survive refactors.** Renaming files, helpers, or harnesses MUST
  preserve expectation ids. Splitting, combining, narrowing, or changing the user
  outcome creates an explicit contract change and migration for every binding and
  known-gap record that refers to the affected ids.

### Platform support

- Supported feature/engine floor: the affected component's current browser-support
  contract under [AST-013](../AST-013/spec.md).
- Unsupported behavior: a harness that cannot observe an assigned evidence layer
  reports that limitation; it does not pass, skip silently, or substitute a lower
  layer.
- Browser evidence: browser-class expectations run in a real shipping engine. A
  DOM emulator cannot prove focus navigation, native top-layer behavior, computed
  accessibility-tree exposure, contrast, target geometry, or forced-color paint.

## Current-state impact

[Issue #4112](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/issues/4112) established the
reusable pattern-contract direction. The closed
[Switch prototype](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/4113) demonstrated one
contract running through jsdom and Chromium bindings, source-linked expectation ids,
and exact known failures. It also showed why axe and pattern contracts are
complementary: axe finds broad markup violations, while the contract verifies the
state and interaction that make a switch behave as a switch.

The prototype is evidence, not current policy. Its package name, scoring model,
priority names, and harness shape remain implementation choices unless this or
another current record adopts them. This spec keeps the proven contract boundary
while correcting two risks before scale-out: a numeric score must not stand in for
conformance, and each expectation must name the evidence layer that can actually
observe its outcome.

The completeness review incorporates recurrent component-owned failures such as
text alternatives, semantic relationships and order, focus order and visibility,
descriptive labels and links, consistent identification, persistent instructions,
and name/role/value/state. It updates that review to WCAG 2.2 and keeps page-owned,
browser-owned, and real-AT-owned checks outside a component runtime contract when
that is the honest boundary.

This accepted spec creates no tests, package, CLI documentation, component behavior,
or CI gate. Those changes follow in implementation work governed by this record.

### Completion criteria

This spec moves from `accepted` to `shipped` only when:

- the reusable contract schema enforces FR4–FR6 and FR9;
- the authoring guide and pull-request template implement FR10–FR13;
- contract self-tests include conforming and deliberately violating fixtures under
  FR11;
- at least one pattern runs against representative jsdom and browser bindings
  without relying on Astryx-private structure;
- unsupported harness capabilities fail honestly rather than passing or skipping;
- no aggregate coverage score is presented as proof of conformance; and
- the shipped guide links AST-009 for real-AT claims and AST-021 for migration.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Use WCAG 2.2 for conformance and WCAG 3.0 only for forward-looking intent

**Reference:** `spec:AST-020/DEC-1`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-03`

WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA provide the current testable baseline. WCAG 3.0 may help
frame user needs, assistive-technology experience, and future evaluation, but its
working draft does not decide current pass/fail results.

Rejected: waiting for WCAG 3.0 or treating a draft outcome as a current conformance
requirement.

### DEC-2 — Author one reusable outcome contract per adopted pattern

**Reference:** `spec:AST-020/DEC-2`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-03`

Separate the standards-derived pattern contract from component bindings. This lets
multiple components share one interpretation while allowing a component's parts to
bind to different patterns and keeping component-specific API behavior local.

Rejected: copying APG assertions into every component test or forcing all
accessibility checks into one global scanner.

### DEC-3 — Make the pull request a readable specification of the executable test

**Reference:** `spec:AST-020/DEC-3`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-03`

A reviewer must be able to judge the user outcome, standards basis, evidence layer,
exemptions, bindings, and mutation proof without reverse-engineering runner code.
The checked contract remains executable truth; the pull request makes that truth
reviewable by accessibility specialists and maintainers.

Rejected: code-only review or a generic accessibility checklist with no exact
mapping to executable expectations.

## Open questions

None.
