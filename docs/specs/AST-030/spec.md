# Positive CI surface routing system spec

## Intent

Route pull-request checks from the repository surfaces a change can affect rather
than from an expanding list of work the change appears not to affect. Contributors
should get the checks that can observe their change, while a narrow operational
Node-tooling change should not wait for unrelated component, browser, Storybook,
or application builds.

The classifier produces a set of touched surfaces. A lane may skip work only when
every changed path is classified from trusted base-branch policy and the selected
checks cover every surface in that set. Mixed, incomplete, or unknown scope uses
the broad lane.

A **lane** is one independently routed logical test or build owner for one
surface. A lane may dispatch multiple workflow jobs or steps and may feed a
historical required-check join. Jobs, workflows, required contexts, and projected
statuses are execution or reporting mechanisms—not additional lanes merely because
they are separately named.

## Non-goals

- Rewrite every CI job or specialize every package lane in one change.
- Add a test-specific or build-specific lane for work already owned by an
  existing surface.
- Apply changed-surface routing to post-merge `main` CI.
- Remove required check names, branch protection, merge-queue coverage, or
  exact-head owner approval.
- Infer safety from file extensions, directory names, or the absence of a known
  risky path.
- Treat tests, specifications, generated files, or changesets as proof that the
  public or operational surface beside them is untouched.

## Requirements

- **FR1 — Classification is positive and set-based.** Every changed path MUST map
  to one or more named surfaces. Lane selection MUST use the union of those
  surfaces, not exclusion predicates over unrelated paths. A path with no exact
  rule MUST add `shared-or-unknown`.
- **FR2 — The taxonomy follows check ownership.** The classifier MAY name only a
  surface with a concrete check owner and dependency boundary. The initial
  taxonomy and current owners are:

  | Surface             | Positive path ownership                                                                                                            | Current check owners                                                                                                                                 |
  | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `knowledge`         | canonical system, family, design, theme, component, and module records                                                             | knowledge validation and exact-head spec-owner approval                                                                                              |
  | `docsite`           | the docsite application                                                                                                            | docsite generation and tests                                                                                                                         |
  | `node-tooling`      | individually admitted operational Node programs and their tests whose consumers are covered by Node contract tests                 | Node Vitest, repository guardrails, and ESLint                                                                                                       |
  | `runtime:<package>` | public source and package contract for Core, Lab, Charts, Rich Text, Vega, CLI, and Build                                          | the package's unit/type checks plus current broad build and downstream consumer checks; Build's owner includes production CSS-layer browser behavior |
  | `theme-build`       | shipped theme packages and theme compilation outputs                                                                               | theme tests, theme package builds, theme-family browser behavior, and stable visual evidence where applicable                                        |
  | `storybook-visual`  | Storybook stories/configuration and visual, accessibility, or RTL audit infrastructure                                             | Storybook build, preview/visual-acceptance publication, and the applicable browser, visual, accessibility, and RTL checks                            |
  | `shared-or-unknown` | shared configuration, dependency graphs, workflows, classifiers, generated ownership, ambiguous paths, and every unclassified path | all applicable pull-request CI checks                                                                                                                |

  A category does not earn a specialized lane merely by existing in this table.
  Until every selected surface has an admitted, complete specialized owner route,
  that surface set uses the broad check set. `shared-or-unknown` always uses the
  broad check set.

- **FR3 — Classification uses trusted base policy.** Pull-request code MUST NOT
  choose its own lane. The workflow MUST load the classifier and every classifier
  dependency from the trusted base ref, then apply that policy to the merge-base
  three-dot path set. Workflow, classifier, classifier-dependency, and routing-test
  changes therefore use the broad lane.
- **FR4 — Uncertainty fails closed.** A missing merge base, missing trusted
  classifier dependency, failed classifier, empty or incomplete file list,
  ambiguous rename, unknown path, or merge-group event without a trusted PR path
  set MUST select the broad lane. No fallback may grant a specialized lane.
- **FR5 — Mixed scope keeps every owner.** A change touching multiple classified
  surfaces MUST run the union of their checks. It MUST NOT run specialized lanes
  for untouched surfaces. A set containing `shared-or-unknown`, a fail-closed
  condition from FR3–FR4, or any selected surface without a complete admitted
  specialized owner route MUST use broad CI. A specification beside runtime code
  does not hide the runtime surface.
- **FR6 — Node-tooling admission is explicit.** A Node program may enter
  `node-tooling` only when dependency analysis proves that package runtime,
  component UI, theme/build output, Storybook/visual evidence, and browser
  behavior are not changed directly, and every operational consumer has a Node
  contract test. Directory-wide or extension-wide admission is prohibited.
- **FR7 — Required check names remain stable.** `test`, `build`, `docsite-test`,
  and `lint` MUST continue to report on every pull request through their existing
  jobs or join jobs. A specialized lane skips owned steps inside those jobs; it
  does not remove historical required contexts. Any owned lane failure MUST fail
  its join.
- **FR8 — The first implementation is one tooling slice.** The first
  `node-tooling` admission covers only `scripts/score-ledger.mjs` and
  `scripts/score-ledger.test.mjs`. It runs the Node project and the required lint
  workflow, including repository guardrails. It skips the UI Vitest project,
  component analysis, docsite generation, production package, Storybook and
  Sandbox builds, preview/visual-acceptance publication, and browser/theme/visual/
  a11y/RTL jobs. The trusted post-CI workflow MUST settle the visual status
  explicitly and remove stale preview links without enqueueing the preview
  publisher. The Sandbox score-ledger projection MUST have a Node contract test
  for the exports it consumes before this lane can be enabled.
- **FR9 — Routing tests are mutation-sensitive.** Tests MUST prove both the
  intended fast path and the unsafe near misses. At minimum they cover pure
  tooling; pure spec; component spec plus component code; module spec plus Table
  plugin code; tooling plus component code; workflow or classifier self-change;
  unknown paths; shared infrastructure; rename history; incomplete input; and
  public source in every component-bearing package. Removing any fail-closed edge
  MUST make a test fail.
- **FR10 — New surfaces follow one admission convention.** A new surface MUST be
  admitted by an owner-approved amendment to this record before implementation.
  The amendment MUST name its positive path ownership, dependency boundary, test
  commands, one independently routed test owner, build commands and one
  independently routed build owner when a build applies, mixed-scope behavior,
  required-check projection, and mutation-sensitive routing tests. A new suite,
  feature, component, theme family, or test type is not a new surface by itself.
- **FR11 — Each surface owns one test and applicable build lane.** A surface MAY
  define multiple test or build commands, jobs, or steps, but exactly one
  independently routed test lane and, when applicable, one independently routed
  build lane MUST own them. New coverage inside an existing surface MUST join
  those owners and MUST NOT create a separately routed lane or required context.
  Existing historical joins remain stable. A selected surface whose dedicated
  owner is not yet admitted continues through broad CI. The Build package's test
  owner includes its production CSS-layer cascade behavior. Theme-family
  compilation remains `theme-build` and does not become Build merely because both
  behaviors concern CSS.
- **FR12 — Visual regression has one shared pull-request owner.** Every
  visual-regression test from every surface MUST use the existing Storybook
  framework and the single shared pull-request visual owner. That owner MAY use
  multiple jobs, workflows, artifacts, and a status projection. A new or existing
  surface, component, package, theme family, or visual suite MUST NOT create
  another independently routed PR visual owner.

### Platform support

- Supported feature/engine floor: GitHub pull-request and merge-group workflows
  on the repository's supported Node and runner versions.
- Unsupported behavior: incomplete or unavailable classification receives no fast
  path and runs broad CI.
- Browser evidence: routing itself has no visual claim; browser checks remain
  mandatory whenever their owning surface is present or scope is uncertain.

## Current-state impact

Current CI has singleton fast paths for canonical specification records, the
docsite, and admitted Node tooling. All other changes run broad Node/UI, build,
browser, and application checks. This accepted record changes no workflow by
itself.

Implementation begins by preserving those existing singleton surface sets and
making their ownership model reusable. Existing package, theme/build, and
Storybook/visual surfaces remain on broad CI until their dedicated owners are
admitted. The current broad workflow may dispatch surface-owned jobs; their names
describe implementation, but they do not receive a specialized route until the
classifier and join contract are complete. New surfaces may add lanes only through
FR10. New coverage joins its current surface owner; visual regression remains in
the shared Storybook PR owner.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Surfaces form a union; lanes are projections

**Reference:** `spec:AST-030/DEC-1`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-07`

A mixed change retains every touched surface and therefore every check owner. A
specialized lane is safe only for an exact surface set whose checks are complete.

Rejected: mutually exclusive labels where `spec-only`, `docs`, or `tooling` can
win over runtime code elsewhere in the same pull request.

### DEC-2 — Unknown and self-modifying scope uses broad CI

**Reference:** `spec:AST-030/DEC-2`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-07`

Classification policy comes from the base branch, and every inability to prove a
specialized set selects broad CI. This keeps a pull request from weakening the
classifier or its dependencies to skip its own checks.

Rejected: head-branch classification, two-dot fallback, directory heuristics, or
a bootstrap fallback that grants a fast path.

### DEC-3 — Start with one explicit Node-tooling ownership group

**Reference:** `spec:AST-030/DEC-3`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-07`

The score-ledger program and tests form the first narrow operational tool group.
Its implementation is validated by Node tests, repository guardrails, ESLint, and
a Node contract for the Sandbox projection; unrelated UI, browser, and production
build work does not observe that change.

Rejected: admitting all of `scripts/`, all JavaScript files, or every Node test by
pattern. Those sets contain generators and build/release inputs with different
owners.

### DEC-4 — CI grows only at a surface boundary

**Reference:** `spec:AST-030/DEC-4`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-12`; clarified `2026-09-15`

Each surface may expose the test and build commands it needs, but pull-request CI
has one independently routed test owner and, when applicable, one independently
routed build owner for that surface. One owner may dispatch multiple jobs or
steps and feed a stable required-check join; those mechanics do not create more
lanes. Existing-surface coverage joins those owners. A genuinely new surface may
add owners only after the complete FR10 admission contract is approved. A named
surface without a complete admitted owner remains on broad CI.

Visual regression is the exception to per-surface routing: every surface
registers its cases with the one shared Storybook-backed PR visual owner. Its
jobs, workflows, artifacts, and status projection are not additional visual
lanes.

Build's production CSS-layer cascade is a Build package integration contract, so
it belongs to Build's test owner. Theme-family compilation remains owned by
`theme-build`; sharing CSS concepts does not collapse those surfaces.

Rejected: per-suite, per-component, per-feature, per-theme-family, or separate
PR visual owners; counting internal jobs or required status projections as
lanes; and implicit expansion under an undefined “additional specialized
surface” exception.
