# Theme application

This record defines how a compiled theme becomes active for a React tree and the
browser document.

## Purpose

People should see the same theme in normal content, nested theme regions,
portals, and non-CSS consumers. Mounting more than one provider must not create
duplicate styles or let one provider remove styles another provider still uses.

## System model

`Theme` receives a `DefinedTheme`, a color mode, and children.

- It registers the theme by name.
- For a theme that was not built ahead of time, it asks the web compiler for CSS
  and mounts that CSS in the document.
- For a built theme, it assumes the consumer loaded the stylesheet and does not
  compile or inject it again.
- It wraps children with the theme name and color mode.
- The root provider also writes the active theme name and explicit light/dark mode
  to `<html>`. Nested providers do not change `<html>`.

`useTheme` normally reads the nearest provider through React context.

When there is no provider context—such as content rendered into a separate React
root or a fallback viewport—it can follow only the root theme through one shared
fallback path:

1. The root `Theme` writes its theme name and explicit light/dark mode to
   `<html>`.
2. `useTheme` reads those attributes and shares one observer per document.
3. It looks up the theme object by name in the shared registry.
4. Every no-provider consumer reuses that path instead of creating its own
   observer.

A normal React portal keeps provider context and does not need this fallback.
The fallback cannot recover a nested provider for a separate React root. Content
that needs a nested theme must keep that provider context in the same React tree.

`MediaTheme` marks a local surface as dark, light, automatically detected, or
off. Compiled theme CSS uses that marker to switch surface tokens while keeping
the parent theme's component rules.

`AppShell` uses the same provider/root-fallback identity path to resolve named
mobile-navigation width points. The nearest Theme wins; without provider context
it follows the registered root theme, and without an active theme it uses the
standard width map.

## Boundaries and invariants

- **INV1 — The nearest provider wins.** Children read the closest Theme context
  and CSS scope.
- **INV2 — Only the root provider changes `<html>`.** Nested providers stay local
  and cannot change browser chrome or portal-wide theme identity.
- **INV3 — Detached consumers share one root-theme store.** A separate React
  root or fallback viewport reads root attributes and the theme registry through
  one internal store with one observer per document. A normal React portal keeps
  provider context. The fallback cannot recover a nested provider.
- **INV4 — Built themes are not compiled again.** A theme marked as built uses its
  loaded stylesheet and skips runtime style generation and injection.
- **INV5 — Runtime styles are shared safely.** Multiple providers using the same
  unbuilt theme share one document-level style set. Styles are removed only when
  no mounted provider still needs them.
- **INV6 — Provider consumers avoid document observation.** `useTheme` under a
  provider reads context directly. Shared document observers exist only for
  no-provider consumers and are disconnected when unused.
- **INV7 — System mode follows the platform.** `system` resolves to the active
  light/dark preference without writing a forced mode to `<html>`.
- **INV8 — Media surfaces do not replace the theme.** `MediaTheme` changes local
  surface tokens and optional surface-specific component rules. It keeps the
  active theme and does not remount children when switched off.
- **INV9 — Application does not change compiled rules.** The provider may mount,
  share, and remove compiler output. It must not create different theme-to-CSS
  behavior from the build path.
- **INV10 — Named responsive consumers share Theme metadata.** AppShell resolves
  `sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl`/`2xl` from the nearest active theme through the same root
  fallback as other no-provider consumers. Its mobile side is strictly below the
  point; equality belongs to the wider layout.

This record does not own theme authoring, token definitions, compiler output, or
which component parts are public theme targets.

## Change coupling

- A provider nesting change tests root, nested, portal, and cleanup behavior.
- A style-lifetime change tests two providers using the same theme and confirms
  that unmounting one does not break the other.
- A root-attribute change tests browser mode, portal reach, and no-provider hooks
  together.
- A `useTheme` fallback change tests provider and no-provider paths and confirms
  that provider consumers do not create document observers.
- A MediaTheme change tests dark, light, auto, off, fallback, and unchanged child
  identity.
- A change to runtime compilation belongs first in the shared compiler and is
  checked against the static build path.

## Owning code

- `Theme.tsx` owns provider scope, runtime style lifetime, and root document sync.
- `themeRegistry.ts` owns server-safe lookup by theme name.
- `useTheme.ts` owns provider access and the shared root fallback used by
  detached consumers. Its observation and subscription logic stays
  single-owned; extracting another module is not part of this contract.
- `MediaTheme.tsx` owns local light/dark surface context.
- `AppShell.tsx` consumes the nearest effective width map for mobile navigation.
- `architecture:theme-compilation` owns the CSS that Theme mounts.

## Deciding specs

- `spec:AST-012/DEC-1` owns the fixed width-point vocabulary AppShell consumes.
