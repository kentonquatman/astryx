# CLI surface architecture

## Purpose

The Astryx CLI is how an agent reaches Astryx. Everything an agent needs while
building with the design system — what exists, what it does, how to use it,
what is wrong with the code in front of it — is reachable through one command
surface, in one predictable shape, with no person in the loop.

The CLI has one audience: an agent running it in a subprocess. A person at a
terminal is a supported reader of the output, never the caller the design
serves. Every rule below follows from that one fact.

This record describes the shipped surface: how a command is invoked, what it
may emit, how it fails, and where its code lives. It does not describe what
the commands do.

## System model

A run has four stages, and each one is a place where the surface is enforced
rather than left to the command author.

1. **Preflight.** `clients/cli/bin/astryx.mjs` gates the Node version using
   only built-ins, before importing anything that could fail on an old
   runtime. The gate honours `--json` with a hand-rolled envelope carrying
   `ERR_NODE_VERSION`.
2. **Dispatch.** `clients/cli/index.mjs` parses with Commander, sets JSON mode
   in `preAction` before any command body runs, and rejects a command that
   cannot support `--json` before any side effect.
3. **Work.** The command parses its arguments and calls a function in `api/`.
   The command is a thin wrapper: parse, call, render. The API function is the
   unit that is scriptable and typed, and it is the source of truth for the
   `type` discriminator on its own envelope.
4. **Render.** Exactly one of two paths. In `--json` mode, `jsonOut` writes a
   single envelope. Otherwise the formatters render the same values as text.
   Nothing else may write to stdout.

Discovery of components, templates, themes, codemods and docs is not per-command. It
goes through the `Project` seam in `foundation/config`, which resolves the
integrations named in `astryx.config` and then autolinks any DECLARED dependency
that ships a root `astryx.integration.*` manifest — a config entry is how a
project pins an integration, not how the CLI finds one. Each integration is
loaded independently, so one broken package degrades that package's
contribution and never fails the run.

AST-017 DEC-4 owns stable response-entry fields and requires their complete type,
test, applicable text, and consumer-documentation projections.

## Boundaries and invariants

- **INV1 — The CLI never asks a question.** No prompt, no TTY detection, no
  read of stdin for control flow. A non-TTY environment is the only supported
  condition, not a fallback. A command with nothing to do exits with a result,
  never a question.
- **INV2 — Every `--json` emission is one valid envelope.** Success is
  `{apiVersion, type, data}` plus optional `meta`. Failure is
  `{apiVersion, error, code}` plus optional `suggestions`. There is no third
  shape, no partial write, and no raw stack trace: an uncaught throw becomes an
  envelope at the bin error boundary.
- **INV3 — The code is the contract; the prose is not.** `code` is stable and
  append-only. Once shipped, a code's meaning never changes and the code is
  never removed. The `error` string may be reworded at any time. A consumer
  branches on `code`.
- **INV4 — Human output is a projection of the JSON, produced only by the
  formatters.** `emit` accepts a renderer-produced `Block` and nothing else, so
  a stray string cannot reach stdout. Output is plain ASCII: no colour, no TTY
  detection, no width wrapping, byte-for-byte identical printed or piped.
- **INV5 — Text field names mirror JSON keys one to one.** The two views cannot
  drift, and every field stays greppable.
- **INV6 — One command, one file.** A command is
  `clients/cli/commands/<name>.mjs`, or `clients/cli/commands/<name>/index.mjs`
  when it is a group, with a sibling `<name>.doc.mjs`. A subcommand's doc is
  `<parent>-<child>.doc.mjs`.
- **INV7 — Every command ships a `CommandDoc`, and the generated surfaces come
  from it.** Help text, the README command and error-code tables, and the
  manifest are generated. None of them is written by hand.
- **INV8 — Exit codes do not depend on the output mode.** The same condition
  exits the same way with and without `--json`, so a command works as a gate
  without parsing stdout.
- **INV9 — A command that cannot support `--json` is rejected before any side
  effect**, not part-way through the work.
- **INV10 — Every write is confined.** Output paths pass `assertWithin`, which
  canonicalises symlinks and rejects a NUL byte; an escape is
  `ERR_PATH_TRAVERSAL`. Bounded inputs are capped rather than trusted.
- **INV11 — A broken integration degrades, it does not fail the run.** The
  `Project` seam loads each integration independently and records the failure.
- **INV12 — Human chatter never touches stdout in JSON mode.** `humanLog` and
  `humanWarn` are the only chatter primitives, and both are no-ops under
  `--json`.
- **INV13 — Agent docs have one rendered source of truth.** Init and upgrade
  render configured integration `agentDocs` through the existing `Project`
  seam. Upgrade compares complete block bytes even when Core is unchanged and,
  when codemods or hooks run, writes the prepared block only after they succeed.
- **INV14 — An installed integration is discoverable without configuration, and
  autolinking it can only add.** A dependency the project DECLARES in
  package.json, and that ships a root `astryx.integration.*` manifest, is
  loaded; `node_modules` is never walked, so nothing the project did not declare
  can contribute. Only the dependency KEY is read, never its value, so an npm
  alias or a non-semver protocol resolves like any other. A config entry keeps
  precedence over the same package autolinked, and a dependency whose manifest
  fails to load is dropped rather than raised as the consuming project's issue.
- **INV15 — Integration authoring writes one complete, discoverable contribution.**
  `integration add <kind> <name>` and its typed per-kind APIs share one receipt
  contract. A dry run reports the same planned paths without writing. A real run
  refuses to clobber authored files, stages related writes atomically, declares
  a contribution root only with valid bytes behind it, and verifies visibility
  through the same discovery seam consumers use.
- **INV16 — Authoring preserves package policy and local source wins while it is
  being edited.** Writers never create `files` or `exports`; when either field
  already exists, they add only the required manifest, root, or public subpath
  and preserve every author-owned entry. The integration beside the current
  package.json replaces the same installed package in place, preserving its
  configured order while making working bytes authoritative.
- **INV17 — Pack verification examines the artifact consumers receive.**
  `integration pack --check` runs the package lifecycle through `npm pack`,
  compares the required file inventory with the actual tarball, extracts that
  tarball into a scratch consumer, reruns contribution discovery, and verifies
  advertised component and template imports through Node's package resolver.
- **INV18 — Integration diagnostics are read-only and package-specific.** Doctor
  validation reports malformed or unreachable roots and contribution conflicts
  without rewriting the package. Everyday discovery skips a broken integration
  and records its issue; a package-scoped theme lookup surfaces that package's
  blocking catalog error instead of misreporting the theme as unknown.
- **INV19 — Integration themes are packaged editable source.** The manifest's
  `themes` root contains a versioned catalog. Each entry names its slug, source
  entry, named runtime export, and complete file list. Discovery parses the entry
  without executing it, requires every local static import and re-export to name
  a file in that list, and rejects missing or type-only named exports. Pack
  verification preserves that identity; `theme list` retains package ownership;
  `theme add --package` copies every listed file, including nested palette/token
  modules, before `theme build` compiles the consumer-owned copy.

## Change coupling

A change to any of the following requires this record to be re-read, and
updated in the same pull request when it moves an invariant:

- adding, removing, or renaming a command or subcommand;
- adding an error code, or changing what an existing code means;
- a change to a stable JSON envelope or discriminated response-entry field
  follows `spec:AST-017/DEC-4`;
- adding a formatter, or writing to stdout from anywhere other than `emit` and
  `jsonOut`;
- changing the file layout under `clients/cli/commands`;
- changing an integration writer's receipt, no-clobber/rollback behavior, or
  package.json mutation policy;
- changing what `integration pack --check` executes or proves about the tarball;
- changing local, configured, or autolinked integration precedence;
- changing the integration theme catalog or consumer copy contract.

`pnpm check:cli-structure` enforces the layout. The contract tests listed in
`verified_by` enforce the envelope, the exit codes, the error codes, and the
non-interactive guarantee.

## Owning code

- `clients/cli/bin/astryx.mjs` — Node floor gate and the error boundary that
  converts an uncaught throw into an envelope.
- `clients/cli/index.mjs` — Commander wiring, JSON-mode gate, dispatch.
- `clients/cli/commands/<name>.mjs` — one command: parse, call the API, render.
- `clients/cli/commands/<name>.doc.mjs` — the `CommandDoc` that generates help
  and the published tables.
- `clients/cli/formatters/index.mjs` — `Block`, `emit`, `section`, `text`,
  `list`, `record`, `records`, `code`, and the shared ASCII vocabulary.
- `foundation/response/json.mjs` — `API_VERSION`, `jsonOut`, `jsonError`,
  `toErrorEnvelope`, `humanLog`, `humanWarn`, the JSON-mode flag.
- `foundation/response/error-codes.mjs` — the frozen, append-only code set.
- `foundation/config` — the `Project` discovery seam and integration precedence.
- `foundation/integrations/manifest-writer.mjs` — safe manifest-root patching,
  verification, and rollback.
- `foundation/integrations/contribution-inventory.mjs` — the shared local and
  packed contribution identity/file contract.
- `api/integration` — contribution writers, diagnostics, and packed-artifact
  verification.
- `foundation/discovery/theme-discovery.mjs` and `api/theme` — integration theme
  catalog discovery, package-aware selection, source copy, and build.
- `foundation/agent-docs` — the shared expected-block renderer and managed-file
  writer used by init and upgrade.
- `api/<subject>/…` — the scriptable functions the commands wrap; each owns the
  `type` on its own envelope.

## Deciding specs

- `spec:AST-017/DEC-4` — stable response fields and their complete projections
  are current compatibility authority.

## Open questions

- **OQ1 — Should the envelope's `meta` carry the resolved integration set?**
  (`human-api`) An agent cannot currently tell from the output whether a thin
  result means "nothing matches" or "an integration failed to load".
