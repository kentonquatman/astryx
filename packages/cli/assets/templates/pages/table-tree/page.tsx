/**
 * A repository you can drill into: folder, subfolder, file, in one table whose
 * folder rows carry the newest commit from everything beneath them.
 *
 * A tree table earns its complexity when the parent rows are *derived from*
 * the children. A plain folder listing does not qualify — a folder with a
 * blank column has nothing to say at its own level, so a tree view is enough,
 * and a table just adds a header row that is true of no row beneath it. What
 * makes a repository qualify is that a folder has a real answer: its last
 * commit is the most recent commit inside it. Then "src changed 2 hours ago"
 * and "src/components is what changed" are the same question at two zoom
 * levels, which is exactly what this shape is for.
 *
 * ## Extending this template
 *
 * **Two hooks, and neither one is the tree.** `useTableTreeState` owns the
 * expanded set and flattens the nested data into the visible rows;
 * `useTableTreeData` is the render plugin that draws the per-level indent and
 * the chevron in the tree column. You pass the first one's `treeConfig`
 * straight into the second. Hand-rolling this — a Set of open ids plus a
 * recursive flatten on every render — is the usual way tree tables get built,
 * and it costs you the ARIA (`aria-level`, `aria-expanded`), the expand-all
 * control, and the guarantee that every level shares one column grid.
 *
 * **Sorting composes with the hierarchy instead of flattening it.**
 * `useTableSortableState` returns an `applySort` that is handed to the tree's
 * `sortSiblings`, so a sort reorders each sibling group in place and children
 * never leave their parent. Sorting by date does not interleave a file with
 * the folder that contains it.
 *
 * **Rollups are computed from the leaves, never stored.** `withRollups` walks
 * the fixture once and gives every folder the newest commit beneath it, so a
 * folder can never disagree with its contents. Message and date are copied
 * from the *same* child rather than reduced separately — taking the newest
 * date and the longest message would describe two different commits on one
 * row. Hardcoding either is the bug this shape exists to prevent.
 *
 * **Search prunes the tree and takes the chevrons with it.** A query keeps any
 * branch with a match anywhere beneath it and force-expands what survives, so
 * results are never hidden behind a collapsed parent. While a query is active
 * the expanded set is derived rather than stored, and manual toggling is
 * suspended; clearing the box restores exactly the expansion state the user had
 * before searching.
 *
 * **A pruned tree has to be re-rolled.** `withRollups` runs again on the
 * pruned result, because removing children changes what every ancestor
 * contains. Skipping that second pass is the subtle bug in most filtered tree
 * tables: the rows are correct, the parents are stale, and a folder quietly
 * advertises a commit that no surviving file beneath it carries. If you add a
 * filter of any kind, re-roll after it.
 *
 * **Ids are paths, and that is load-bearing.** Every node's id is its full
 * path, so the parent lookup for ArrowLeft and the row keys all fall out of
 * string operations instead of a second index. If you swap in data keyed by
 * uuid, you need an explicit `parentId` and the keyboard plugin has to walk
 * that instead.
 *
 * **Arrow keys are a local plugin, not a core one.** `useTableTreeData` gives
 * you the ARIA but no key handling, so `useTreeKeyboardNav` below implements
 * the APG treegrid keys through `transformTable` (one `onKeyDown`) and
 * `transformBodyRow` (roving `tabIndex`). It is written as a real
 * `TablePlugin` rather than a wrapper div so it composes with the other
 * plugins in the same `plugins={{}}` bag. Lift it into core if you need it in
 * more than one place.
 *
 * **The rows carry a cursor, not a selection.** The keyboard plugin moves a
 * roving `tabIndex` and nothing else — no `aria-selected`, no selected-row
 * tint. A repository listing has no bulk action to select *for*, and a
 * persistent highlight competes with the zebra stripe for the same signal. If
 * you do need real selection, reach for `useTableSelection` rather than
 * widening this one.
 *
 * **The tree column wraps and does not truncate.** That is a documented
 * limitation of `useTableTreeData`: `textOverflow="truncate"` does not reach
 * inside the tree column, because the indent and expander need the cell to be a
 * flex row. Name and the commit subject both take `proportional()` so the two
 * variable-length columns share the slack; the date is `pixel()` because its
 * text has a known ceiling.

const README = `## canvas-editor

A small, embeddable vector canvas. Draw shapes, group them, and serialise the
result to JSON that round-trips without loss.

### Install

\`\`\`bash
npm install canvas-editor
\`\`\`

### Usage

\`\`\`ts
const {Canvas} = await import('canvas-editor');

const canvas = new Canvas(document.querySelector('#root'));
canvas.add({kind: 'rect', x: 0, y: 0, width: 120, height: 80});
\`\`\`

### Status

| Area        | State    | Notes                                  |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Rendering   | Stable   | Dirty-rect redraw, no full repaints    |
| Serialising | Stable   | Round-trips groups and nested shapes   |
| Plugins     | Beta     | API may change before 1.0              |

### Contributing

Read [the contributing guide](#) first. In short:

- One change per pull request, with a test that fails without it.
- Run \`npm test\` before pushing.
- Conventional commits — the changelog is generated from them.

> Issues tagged \`good first issue\` are a reasonable place to start.

How the canvas is put together, and how to work on it.

### Start here

- **getting-started.md** — install the package and draw your first shape.
- **contributing.md** — branch naming, the release checklist, how to get review.

### Architecture

The \`architecture/\` folder covers the parts that are hard to infer from the
source: how the dirty-rect redraw path decides what to repaint, and who owns
the undo stack.
