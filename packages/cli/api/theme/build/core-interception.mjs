/**
 * @file Capture a theme's authored adaptation input as the theme file loads.
 *
 * `astryx theme build` resolves a theme by calling the INSTALLED core's
 * `defineTheme()`. A core that predates ordered adaptations builds its result
 * field by field and drops `adaptations` on the way in, so by the time the
 * build holds a theme object, the author's rules are gone without a trace —
 * and building anyway would emit CSS with every adaptation rule silently
 * missing.
 *
 * Rather than re-deriving the author's intent from the source (which means
 * following factories, barrels, spreads and package resolution — an incomplete
 * JS interpreter, and a bug farm), this watches the real thing happen. The
 * theme is already loaded through jiti; jiti's `virtualModules` lets us hand
 * the theme file a `@astryxdesign/core/theme` whose `defineTheme` is the
 * installed one wrapped in a recorder. Every call — in the theme file, in a
 * relative base, in an installed package, at any depth — hands us the raw
 * input before the old resolver can erase it. The JS engine does the
 * evaluating; we only observe.
 *
 * ## Lineage, not a pile of calls
 *
 * A module can define several themes, and only one of them is the theme being
 * built. Failing a build because SOME theme in the import graph uses
 * adaptations would be wrong — an unused adaptive theme sitting in the same
 * file must not fail its plain sibling. So each returned theme is associated
 * with the input it came from, and capability detection walks only the
 * selected theme's own lineage:
 *
 * - a WeakMap keyed by the returned object, for themes handled by reference;
 * - an enumerable Symbol on the returned object, because a theme is routinely
 *   OBJECT-SPREAD (`{...base, name: 'child'}`) and a spread copies enumerable
 *   symbol keys while a WeakMap entry does not survive it.
 *
 * The Symbol is scoped to one isolated load and stripped before the theme
 * reaches any output path. It cannot leak into a generated file regardless:
 * `JSON.stringify`, `Object.keys` and `Object.entries` all ignore symbol keys.
 *
 * Used only when the installed core cannot compile adaptations. A core that
 * can reports them on the resolved theme itself, which needs none of this.
 *
 * ## Reach, and its one edge
 *
 * jiti hands a module's imports back to itself only when it TRANSPILES that
 * module, so the load runs through jiti's synchronous path (see
 * `importThemeModule`), which transpiles installed ESM packages too — a
 * package whose source calls `defineTheme` is observed like any other module.
 * `patchCommonJs` covers `.cjs` source, which jiti always loads natively, by
 * wrapping the core's own CommonJS exports object for the duration of the
 * load.
 *
 * One combination stays out of reach: a `.cjs` package source resolving an
 * ESM-ONLY core. Node's `require(esm)` hands it a frozen/non-configurable module
 * namespace, which cannot be patched in place. `patchCommonJs` reports that
 * coverage gap; if the selected theme's lineage then contains an unobserved
 * member, the build fails closed rather than assuming erased adaptations were
 * absent. A package's BUILT artifact remains supported because it carries
 * `__adaptations` as observable plain data.
 *
 * The same capture also retains raw typography, color, radius, and motion axes.
 * Older cores resolve those inputs into tokens but do not expose `__axes`; the
 * CLI reconstructs the effective metadata with current core's merge semantics
 * so a later current-core child can extend the built artifact source-equivalently.
 *
 * SYNC: packages/cli/api/theme/build/build.mjs (importThemeModule)
