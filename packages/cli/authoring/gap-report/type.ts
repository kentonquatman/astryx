/**
 * Public type surface for gap-report handlers.
 *
 * A handler receives a normalized gap report and routes it to a destination.
 * Project config may define one (`gapReport` in `astryx.config`); every loaded
 * integration may export one as a `gapReport` NAMED export. The CLI composes
 * them additively: project handler first, then each integration handler in
 * config order. Every handler receives a `structuredClone` of the same
 * normalized report.
 *
 * This module is the shared authoring surface for both config and integration
 * gap-report handlers.
