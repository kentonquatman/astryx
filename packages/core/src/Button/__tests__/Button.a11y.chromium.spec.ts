 * @file Button.a11y.chromium.spec.ts
 * @input Uses @playwright/test, @astryxdesign/a11y-spec (the button contract,
 *   the Chromium harness, the static Storybook server), and the checked-in
 *   ButtonA11y stories
 * @output The real-browser lane of every binding to the shared button pattern:
 *   computed role, name and description, native activation by pointer, Enter
 *   and Space, pointer cancellation, tab reachability, and inertness.
 * @position The half of the binding jsdom cannot honestly reach
 *   (`docs/specs/AST-013/spec.md`: a browser claim is made in a browser).
 *
 * Each state drives a checked-in story rather than a page this file builds, so
 * the reproduction path for any failure is a URL a person can open
 * (`docs/specs/AST-009/spec.md` FR30). Each story counts its own activations,
 * which is what the contract reads through the binding's `activations()` seam —
 * a button's action leaves no trace on the button itself.
 *
 * SYNC: States live in ./Button.a11y.states.ts, known failures in
 *   ./Button.a11y.known-failures.ts, both shared with the jsdom lane.
