 * @file Button.a11y.states.ts
 * @input Uses ButtonStateFacts from @astryxdesign/a11y-spec
 * @output BUTTON_BINDING_STATES — every state of every component that adopts the
 *   button pattern that can change what the pattern promises — and
 *   BUTTON_PATTERN_EXCLUSIONS, the parts deliberately left to another pattern.
 * @position The binding inventory required before any assertion moves
 *   (`docs/specs/AST-021/spec.md` FR2, FR4), and the single definition of what
 *   each state IS.
 *
 * A state earns a row when it can change what the button pattern promises: a
 * different name source, a different operability, a different exposure of
 * unavailability, a different attached description. States that change only
 * appearance — variant, size, elevation, width, end content, theme — cannot, so
 * they stay in each component's own suite where that component owns them.
 *
 * This file is DATA ONLY — no JSX, no component imports. The Chromium lane runs
 * under Playwright's plain Node runtime, which does not apply the StyleX
 * transform, so importing a component here would break that lane before it
 * started. How each state is rendered lives beside it in
 * ./Button.a11y.renders.tsx, in a map TypeScript requires to be exhaustive: a
 * new row here is a compile error until it has a rendering.
 *
 * A row without a rendering is a compile error, so that half needs no
 * vigilance. The story export is the half that does.
 *
 * SYNC: Every row needs a named export in
 * - /apps/storybook/stories/ButtonA11y.stories.tsx
 *   Caught at run time, not compile time: the Chromium binding navigates to
 *   each row's `storyId`, so a missing or renamed export fails that lane.
