# 0.5.2

---

# 0.5.1

#### Fixes

- Theme packages no longer ship an unused CommonJS `icons.js` artifact. Their root entry keeps its advertised CommonJS and ESM outputs, while the standalone icon companion used by `/built` is emitted only as `icons.mjs`. (#5512)

# 0.4.5

---

# 0.4.4

---

# 0.4.3

#### Fixes

- The `/built` entry now loads under Node ESM and externalized SSR (Vite `--ssr`, Remix / React Router v7): it imports `./icons.mjs` instead of the extensionless `./icons` Node cannot resolve.

#### New Features

- Rework Y2K dark-mode surfaces to a cool "night periwinkle" indigo palette
  Dark mode now echoes the light theme's periwinkle body instead of warm cream-derived browns: body `#0e0f1a`, surface/card `#16182b`, popover/muted `#1f2238`, with cool off-white text (`#EDEFFC`). Light mode and all categorical pop colors are unchanged.
